Your grade school Math teacher visited you at Hack Reactor, expecting
you to do an old assignment to see if you're still a smart cookie. 
In fact, your teacher expects you to do this every week to make sure 
you keep practiced! How frustrating! 

The assignment: Count the number of distinct words in a paragraph and 
submit it to her. 

However, you now have the power of code to do it within an instant and
can do it in a fraction of a second without her knowing :) 

TLDR; Write a function that reads an input file and outputs a .txt file 
containing the word count of every word in your input.txt

/*                                                  */

const fs = require('fs');

var countAllWords = function(filePath) {
  /* WRITE CODE HERE */ 
}
